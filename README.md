So far, I've shared ideas through elm packages.
But well... some ideas have not worked out, some were abandoned, some are about external tools.

#### run locally

```shell
npm install && \
npx vite
```
then open http://localhost:5173/


For all future runs, you just need
```shell
npx vite
```

### contributing
Before building the new version, `cd build-step` and run
```bash
elm-cli run src/Build.elm $EPOCHSECONDS
```
to generate the new rss feed.
