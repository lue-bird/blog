So far, I've shared ideas through elm packages.
But well... some ideas have not worked out, some were abandoned, some are about external tools.

So far you'll only find thoughts here that are in the process of being formalized.
Nothing is "published" anywhere so if you find this though github, enjoy what's already here
or wait another year until there _might_ be a running website with rss and whatnot.
